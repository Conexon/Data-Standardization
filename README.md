## Data-Standardization

This is the data standardization repository. The purpose of this is to continue the process of standardizing coop data for Conexon clients. More documents live here:

# Below are explanations of the client data that we request for designing and constructing fiber optic networks. Those who standardize client data need to know what they are looking for:

Conexon design and construction requires a minimum of five input spatial data sets in order to start our design process. Those five are (1) Substations, (2) Customers, (3) Spans, (4) Poles and (5) Underground Transformers. Data delivery can be either in an ESRI File Geodatabase or individual ESRI Shapefiles. 
Conexon requires two supplementary data sets for better network connectivity and construction efficiency. Those two are (6) SCADA devices and (7) Any Existing Fiber Data if applicable.
Below are the requirements for these files. In ESRI speak, these would be individual Feature Classes. All spatial data need to have the same defined state plane projection in US feet. If this is not what you use within your mapping system, please let Conexon know.
